                Hi! My name is Jacob Yosowitz, I am an architecture student at 
                the University of Michigan. I grew up in flatland (midwest USA), 
                but my outdoorsy family made effort to venture out to the mountains 
                whenever possible. Influenced by my upbringing, I've grown to become an 
                avid climber, (self-proclaimed) expert snowboarder, amature campfire chef, tree-hugger, 
                and a passionate environmentalist. I wish to spread my love for the outdoors 
                via camera, hopefully influencing people to consider their connection with 
                nature and inspire positive environmental action.
            </p>
